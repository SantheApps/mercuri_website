                    <h2>18. General Terms</h2>
                    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Mercuri regarding the Services and supersede prior agreements on the same subject matter. If any provision is unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver. You may not assign these Terms without prior written consent from Mercuri.</p>
